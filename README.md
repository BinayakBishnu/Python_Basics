# Python_classes
### Beginner's approach

The python file has the code for various ways of working with Classes in python.

It starts with definition and instances (class objects) of classes

This is followed by using constructors, class variables, methods (member functions)

Then I tried out class methods and static methods
- updating class variables using class methods
- parsing strings using class mathods
- classifying days of the week using static methods (imported datetime module)

This was followed by extensive maipulation of concept of subclasses and inheritance
- differentiating between objects of Parent and Child classes
- testing method of over-writing values by Child classes
- accessing Parent class elements via Child class objects
- calling Parent class methods via Child class objects
- trying out method to check is one class is subclass of another
